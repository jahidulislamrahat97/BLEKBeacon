# BLEKBeacon Library

The BLEKBeacon library  is a opesource library it provides functionality to process BLE beacon data, specifically for [KBeacon](https://www.kkmcn.com/bluetooth-beacon) devices (e.g. KBPro_xxxx). It extracts various sensor data from the beacon payload such as voltage, temperature, humidity, accelerometer, cutoff sensor, PIR, light sensor reading.
